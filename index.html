        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This policy paper addresses the urgent need for comprehensive personal finance education in the United States. 
            It outlines the current challenges, proposes actionable solutions, and emphasizes the benefits of integrating 
            personal finance education into the K-12 curriculum. The objective is to equip future generations with the knowledge 
            and skills necessary to manage their finances effectively, reduce debt, and build wealth.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Personal finance is a critical life skill, yet many Americans lack the necessary knowledge to make informed financial 
            decisions. According to a survey by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), two-thirds of Americans cannot 
            pass a basic financial literacy test. This deficiency contributes to high levels of personal debt, insufficient savings, 
            and financial stress.

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            The lack of personal finance education in schools leaves young adults unprepared to navigate financial challenges. 
            The consequences are evident in rising student loan debt, credit card debt, and low retirement savings. The current 
            educational framework does not adequately address these issues, leading to a knowledge gap that perpetuates financial 
            instability.

        <h2>Policy Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            This policy paper proposes a mandatory personal finance education program for all K-12 students. The program will be 
            integrated into the existing curriculum and tailored to different educational levels. Key components of the program 
            include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Curriculum Development:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop age-appropriate financial literacy modules for elementary, middle, and high school students.</li>
                    <li>Topics will include budgeting, saving, investing, credit management, and retirement planning.</li>
                    <li>Collaborate with financial experts and educators to ensure the curriculum is comprehensive and engaging.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Teacher Training:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide professional development for teachers to effectively deliver personal finance education.</li>
